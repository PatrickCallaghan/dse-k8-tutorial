# Accessing DSE from the outside

## pinning a node to a host

Accessing the node from outside the cluster is challenging. 

The easiest solution is to pin the dse instance to a specific host and use this host as contact point.
in order to pin dse to a restricted set of k8 host, put labels on the nodes: 

```bash
kubectl label nodes <node-name> <label-key>=<label-value>
```

### Using Hostport
Now that our pods are pinned to a specific host, we need to expose our pod port to the host.
It can be done with the `hostPort: 9042` instruction.

### using NodePort

A better way is to use a NodePort service with `spec.externalTrafficPolicy: Local`. By setting the policy to local, the host will only forward the traffic to the local pods. Because we only deploy 1 DSE node per k8 host, it'll redirect the traffic to the proper dse node. 


vim dse-external.yaml :
```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: dse-external
  labels:
    app: dse
spec:
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
  ports:
  - nodePort: 30042
    port: 30042
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 9042
  selector:
    app: dse
  type: NodePort
```

## Broadcast address
Since the node will be accessed from outside of the k8s cluster, we need to broadcast the k8s host IPs to the clients (and not the POD IPs).

This can easily be done with the following conf in your statefulset file to change this setting in the cassandra.yaml file: 
```yaml
...
    env:
    - name: NATIVE_TRANSPORT_BROADCAST_ADDRESS
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: status.hostIP
...
```

apply the changes and run the usual `kubectl apply -f dse.yaml`

We can now check that the node is properly configured:
```bash
kubectl exec dse-0 cat /opt/dse/resources/cassandra/conf/cassandra.yaml | egrep "(^listen_address|^native_transport_broadca)"
listen_address: 100.96.4.3
native_transport_broadcast_address: 172.20.45.192
```

In this case `listen_address: 100.96.4.3` is the pod IP and `native_transport_broadcast_address: 172.20.45.192` is the host (AWS EC2 instance) IP.

If the k8 cluster need to be accessed both from the outside and inside k8s, an AddressTranslators could be used to route the application internal on the `native_transport_address` and not the `native_transport_broadcast_address` (to reproduce something similar to the `prefer_local=true` settings in cassandra-rackdc.properties)

### Testing NodePort
First, create the dse-external service. 

```bash
kubectl create -f dse-external.yaml 

kubectl describe service dse-external
Name:                     dse-external
Namespace:                default
Labels:                   app=dse
Annotations:              kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration:
                            {"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"Service","metadata":{"annotations":{},"labels":{"app":"dse"},"name":"dse-external","namespace":"default"},"spec...
Selector:                 app=dse
Type:                     NodePort
IP:                       100.64.237.233
Port:                     <unset>  30042/TCP
TargetPort:               9042/TCP
NodePort:                 <unset>  30042/TCP
Endpoints:                100.96.3.2:9042,100.96.4.2:9042,100.96.5.2:9042
Session Affinity:         None
External Traffic Policy:  Local
```

The port 30042 should now be exposed on each host having a pod running, and forwarding to the internal pod on 9042:
```bash
netstat -laputen | grep 30042
tcp6       0      0 :::30042                :::*                    LISTEN      0          45513      2466/kube-proxy     
```

To test it, we can try to run cqlsh from one of the k8s node itself. First check on which k8s node (host) your pod is running:
```bash
kubectl describe pod dse-0ame:               dse-0
Namespace:          default
Priority:           0
PriorityClassName:  <none>
Node:               ip-172-20-45-192.eu-west-3.compute.internal/172.20.45.192
...
```
You can connect to this node (use its public IP): ssh admin@35.180.51.203

Install dse locally to get a cqlsh shell:

```bash
echo "deb https://quentin.ambard%40datastax.com:xxxxxx@debian.datastax.com/enterprise/ stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/datastax.sources.list
curl -L https://debian.datastax.com/debian/repo_key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dse-full
```
Try the connection on the 30042 port:
```bash
cqlsh localhost 30042
Connected to My_Cluster at localhost:30042.
[cqlsh 5.0.1 | DSE 6.0.5 | CQL spec 3.4.5 | DSE protocol v2]
